# 62-own-packs.sh (3.2.0): a package's own node packs, VENDORED_PACKS=( dir ... ): folders beside the script that ship
# in its zip (ZIP_EXTRA). The base mirrors each into custom_nodes on every install: the folder becomes exactly what the
# zip carries (a file the pack dropped is gone), and a pack whose content did not change is not touched at all.
#
# Each installed copy carries a stamp, custom_nodes/<dir>/.comfy-base-own (pkg=, version=, digest=), so the next run
# knows what is there without trusting a record. On a shared store two packages may ship the same pack: the newest
# version wins and is never moved backwards; the same version with different bytes is installed and named, because one
# of the two missed a version bump. The copy is staged under state/own/, never inside custom_nodes (ComfyUI imports
# every folder there that is not __pycache__ or *.disabled). The previous folder waits in state/own/prev/<pkg>/ until
# the import check has judged the new one: a pack of the package's own that fails to import is put back and the
# restart is blocked, so the live server keeps the code that worked.
#
# Two steps around the hooks. A package written before 3.2.0 still copies its packs itself in pkg_post_venv, over
# whatever is there: `_base_own_packs_save` keeps the live folder BEFORE the hooks, and `base_own_packs` mirrors AFTER
# them (still before the requirements resolve), so the rollback copy is the real previous one and a newer copy kept
# from another package is put back if a hook wrote over it.
