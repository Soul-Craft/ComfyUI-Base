"""hosts/crusoe/provider.py: Crusoe Cloud behind the host interface.

One VM, one persistent disk, one startup script. The machine side is hosts/crusoe/startup.sh, which Crusoe runs as
root on EVERY boot: it mounts the data disk, gates the NVIDIA driver at 580, installs the CUDA toolkit, writes the
systemd unit and writes state/host.env. This file is the Mac side: what podctl calls to find, reach and move a
machine. hosts/crusoe/README.md is the recipe and records what a first live run should report back.

STILL EXPERIMENTAL. Every call below is written from Crusoe's own API reference and its published client, and the
whole of it is exercised against a fake REST server in suite/test_crusoe.py, but none of it has run against a live
account. Verda sat here once too, and its first live run corrected three things the documentation implied. Until
somebody does the same here the driver says EXPERIMENTAL once per run, and it is right to.

THE API
  base URL      https://api.cloud.crusoe.ai/v1
  auth          an access key id and a secret. EVERY request is signed:
                  payload   = path + "\n" + query + "\n" + VERB + "\n" + timestamp + "\n"
                              (path includes the /v1 prefix; query: parameters sorted by name as "k=v&k=v", empty
                              when there are none)
                  key       = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(secret + padding)      (pad with "=" to a multiple of 4)
                  signature = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(hmac.new(key, payload, sha256).digest()).rstrip("=")
                  headers   X-Crusoe-Timestamp: <timestamp>          (RFC3339, UTC, whole seconds)
                            Authorization: Bearer 1.0:<access_key_id>:<signature>
                Taken from two of Crusoe's own implementations, which agree: client-go auth/v1/auth.go
                (RawURLEncoding both ways, HMAC-SHA256, time.RFC3339 in UTC) and the Python in
                crusoe-registry-token-rotator. The worked example in the prose docs does NOT reproduce under any
                reading, so the code is the authority and the first live 200 is the proof.
  credentials   env CRUSOE_ACCESS_KEY_ID and CRUSOE_SECRET_KEY, else ~/.crusoe/config:
                  [default]
                  access_key_id = ...
                  secret_key = ...
                  default_project = ...
                Never printed, logged or placed in an argument: the secret reaches exactly one place, the HMAC.
  project id    GET /organizations/projects  (the config's default_project by name, else the one project)

THE CALLS                                                    (verified against crusoecloud/client-go swagger/v1)
  GET|POST    /projects/{p}/compute/vms/instances
  GET|PATCH|DELETE
              /projects/{p}/compute/vms/instances/{vm_id}     PATCH body {"action": "START"|"STOP"|"RESET"}
  POST        /projects/{p}/compute/vms/instances/{vm_id}/attach-disks
  POST        /projects/{p}/compute/vms/instances/{vm_id}/detach-disks
  GET         /projects/{p}/compute/vms/instances/operations/{operation_id}
  GET         /projects/{p}/compute/vms/types
  GET         /organizations/projects
  create body name, type, location, ssh_public_key (required); image, startup_script, disks[] optional.
              A disk attachment is {"disk_id": ..., "mode": "read-write", "attachment_type": "data"}.
  async       a lifecycle call answers {"operation": {...}}; poll the operation until state is not IN_PROGRESS.

WHAT IS DIFFERENT HERE, AND WHY THE VERDA PROVIDER IS NOT A TEMPLATE FOR IT
  - stop is a real stop. A stopped Crusoe VM still exists and bills its disks only, so `stop` does not delete and
    `pods` lists instances, never volumes-as-machines. (On Verda a shut-down instance still bills the GPU, which is
    why stopping there deletes and the OS volume stands in for the machine.)
  - the public ip is DYNAMIC: it changes on every stop/start unless the VM was created with a static one. Every
    lifecycle call therefore rewrites the Host block before it returns.
  - the startup script is a CREATE-TIME field and cannot be changed through the API afterwards, and it runs on every
    boot. `ensure` therefore ships the current hosts/crusoe/startup.sh over ssh and runs its --ensure pass, which is
    the only way to update the behaviour of a machine that already exists.
  - the login is ubuntu, not root, so the --ensure pass needs sudo.
  - a disk takes ONE read-write attacher, so `deploy` detaches from the source before creating the clone, and passes
    the disk in the create body rather than attaching afterwards: a VM that boots without its disk sends startup.sh
    into a 15 minute wait for one.
