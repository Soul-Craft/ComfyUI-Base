# Three things per item, in the order that fails cheapest first:
#   1. the built zip matches the working tree            (package.py --check)
#   2. the suite, from the repo                          (<name>-script.sh test / base.sh test)
#   3. the suite, from the EXTRACTED ZIP                 (what the pod runs, and what podctl's gate runs)
#
# Step 3 is the one that keeps being learned: a test that reads _build/, an installed pack, or a path that
# only exists beside the repo passes at step 2 and fails on the pod ten minutes and one upload later. It
# also caught a test that CRASHED from the zip and took the gate down with it.
#
# A package whose script declares PKG_NO_SUITE=1 and ships no suite.py skips steps 2 and 3 as "declared":
# the zip check still runs over it.
