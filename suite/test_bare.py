"""bare tier: the base against an environment that gives it NOTHING.

Every defect the cold-install pod found on 2026-09-08 was the same shape — the base depended on
something its usual surroundings happened to supply for free, and nobody noticed until a machine
turned up without it:

    the shared network volume supplied  tools/bin/uv     -> --check could not bootstrap  (2.0.45)
    the repo checkout supplied         _build/          -> a test crashed the gate       (2.0.46)
    the MooseFS mount supplied         no lost+found    -> the model index gave up       (2.0.47)
    the older pod images supplied      a full CUDA kit  -> both source builds died       (2.0.49)

The rest of the suite tests the base against a realistic environment, which is exactly why none of
these appeared in it. These tests are hostile on purpose: empty roots, missing tools, unreadable
directories, a compiler that cannot link. They run on a Mac in seconds and cost no pod.
