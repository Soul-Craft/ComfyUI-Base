# ComfyUI Base — Handbook

**Version 3.0.3.** The shared toolchain every workflow package on a machine sources, on **any host with an NVIDIA
GPU** (RunPod, Verda, Crusoe, an owned box) and on any image or OS that gives it a driver and Python 3. One command,
run once per machine as **step one**; then each workflow package is **step two**, still one command. From a Mac,
`podctl` reaches the machine and hands its boot to the base (§1); after that every boot is the base's.

## 0. Design rules

1. **The base owns the machine — its boot included; a package owns only what is unique to it.** Toolchain (uv,
   Python, torch, ComfyUI, the shared node packs, launch-arg hygiene), the model library layout, discovery and
   relocation on the volume, the boot (sshd, JupyterLab, ComfyUI), restart survival and shared state are the base's.
   A package declares its workflow, its models, its extra packs and its own steps (hooks), nothing more.
2. **One canonical ComfyUI tree on the volume, one venv beside it, one stamp.** The tree is the one recorded in
   `state/boot.env`, else an existing volume tree (`/workspace/runpod-slim/ComfyUI`, `/workspace/ComfyUI`,
   `/workspace/*/ComfyUI`), else the base materialises `/workspace/ComfyUI` from GitHub at the newest release tag (or a
   newer `COMFY_REF`)  - 
   beside whatever `models/ user/ output/ input/ custom_nodes/` an image already keeps there. The container disk
   (`/ComfyUI`, `/opt/ComfyUI`, `$HOME/ComfyUI`) is never adopted and never scanned: it is restored from the image at
   every start. The venv is `$COMFY/.venv-cu130` (a name kept for every existing volume; its CUDA build is whatever
   §0.3 picks), stamped `.comfy-base-venv` (Python, torch, backend, base, the package that last stamped it); an unstamped venv that passes the probe is adopted and stamped; a rebuild happens at the same
   path with a backup and automatic rollback. A second tree on the volume is reported (`other tree`), its models are
   consolidated into the canonical one, nothing is deleted.
3. **Always the newest, for everything the base installs (3.0.0), and no fallbacks.** Every run, on every host:
   ComfyUI is its newest `vX.Y.Z` release on branch `comfy-base-stable` (`COMFY_REF` may name something NEWER, such as
   master, for one run; an older ref is refused). Every node pack, declared or not, is at its remote's HEAD, never
   moved backwards (local edits stashed by name first). Every Python package is at its newest: ComfyUI's and every
   pack's requirement files are never installed as written, because their `==` pins would put packages back down;
   `py/reqlift.py` merges them into one set with every hold lifted, uv resolves it, and whatever another package's
   cap still holds back is forced to its newest with uv's overrides. A pack whose own newest code cannot import with
   a newest dependency is named ("needs upgrading upstream") and the install goes on; ComfyUI's own startup failing is
   the one thing rolled back (only the packages that run changed). torch is the newest release on the newest CUDA
   build the machine's driver runs (`uv --torch-backend=auto`), never moved backwards on a shared venv. Python is the
   newest CPython minor that resolves that set, its newest patch. uv, JupyterLab, SageAttention (rebuilt when main
   moves), comfy-cli, pytest and huggingface_hub are upgraded every run. The OS packages and the NVIDIA driver
   (NVIDIA's `nvidia-open`) are upgraded first (§0.15). A pick that cannot be made stops the run. A pack row's sha is
   the last-tested record, printed every run and written back by `podctl` after a green install; never a target.
4. **Everything the venv boots from lives on the volume, and the boot cannot brick the machine.**
   `UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR=<volume>/comfy-base/python`, `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON=1`; the probe is HARD on an interpreter
   written to the container disk, so a poisoned venv is never reused. `boot.sh` starts sshd first and never exits,
   so a venv that cannot boot leaves a reachable machine with the reason in the boot log; `rescue` repairs it without
   executing the interpreter. A volume root that is not a mountpoint is refused outright, unless
   `BASE_VOLUME_KIND=dir` says the machine is an owned box (§1).
5. **The library is `models/<category>/<Family>[/<Purpose>]/<upstream filename>`.** A Family is a plain folder name
   (letters, digits, `. _ -`); the base checks the shape, and a brand keeps one spelling per family across its
   packages in `<brand>/families.txt` (§4). Two packages that want the same file declare the same row and it is
   downloaded once. `vae_approx/` is flat; `LLM`, `custom_nodes/<Pack>`, `embeddings`, `sams`, `depthanything`,
   `SEEDVR2`, `RMBG`, `grounding-dino`, `latent_upscale_models` and `insightface` are freeform (flat by their
   consumers' design). Model files in a flat category folder that no row declares (an image's own downloads, the
   user's files) are reported as `unclaimed` and left where they are.
6. **No alternate or optional models.** A package's rows cover every loader that is ACTIVE in its shipped workflow;
   bypassed loaders are reported by name, not downloaded. A `LOCAL` row must already be on the volume or the run
   fails (upload it with `podctl upload`; the next run's scan claims it by name).
7. **The base boots the machine; a run restarts nothing by itself.** `boot.sh` (PID 1 once podctl has pointed a
   RunPod pod's start command at it; the process `comfy-base-boot.service` runs on a VM host) runs sshd → JupyterLab →
   ComfyUI from the base's venv with the base's launch line, then sleeps forever. An install prints the exact launch
   line; `BASE_RESTART=1` stops the running server (found by what it runs, never PID 1) and starts that line, the same
   function boot.sh uses (`lib/85-launch.sh`). One ComfyUI per machine: where `comfy-base-boot.service` is enabled the
   restart is the unit's (`systemctl stop`, then `start`), so the server is always the unit's, and the boot stops any
   ComfyUI it did not start before starting its own (3.0.3).
8. **One deletion prompt, default No.** Duplicates, superseded files (only inside the package's own family
   folders) and partials, never a file another installed package claims (the ledger). `BASE_YES=1` approves.
9. **Privacy and secrets.** Outbound hosts are huggingface.co, github.com, pypi.org, pypi.nvidia.com,
   download.pytorch.org, the distribution's apt mirrors and developer.download.nvidia.com (NVIDIA's CUDA repository); a `MODELS` row may name no other host. Nothing is uploaded. `--disable-api-nodes` is
   launch-arg hygiene. Tokens come from the shell env, else the machine's own environment (PID 1's: `HF_TOKEN` or its
   aliases `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` / `HF_HUB_TOKEN`), else `state/tokens.env` (0600), else one prompt. Template
   placeholders (`token_here`, `replace_with_ids`…) are named and ignored; a token its service rejects fails the run
   before anything downloads. No token ever appears in a log or on the process list: `hf` reads it from its
   environment, and the suite runs with every token name stripped. JupyterLab's token rides `JUPYTER_TOKEN` (or
   `JUPYTER_PASSWORD`) in its environment; without one the boot does not start it and says so (2.1.0). Since 2.5.6,
   where `BASE_LISTEN` is loopback (every host but RunPod, so the terminal is reachable only through an ssh tunnel)
   the boot GENERATES a token instead of leaving the terminal dark, and writes it owner-only to `state/tokens.env`.
   It is still never printed, for the same reason no other token is: with a shared store the boot log is a file every
   machine mounts. `podctl jupyter <machine>` reads it over ssh and prints the URL with the token already in it. On a
   public bind with no credential, 2.1.0's refusal is unchanged.
10. **The base owns ComfyUI's launch flags.** `state/comfyui_args.txt` is the only source. An image's own args file
    (RunPod's `runpod-slim/comfyui_args.txt`) is imported once, on the first real run, and never read again; nothing
    creates a phantom file on images that have none. `HYGIENE_ARGS` entries are ensured present, `HYGIENE_ARGS_REMOVE`
    entries absent (the sage flag stays only when `sageattention` imports in the venv).
11. **The GPU must be ours.** `nvidia-smi` inside a container reports the whole card's memory but lists only the
    container's own processes; memory in use that no visible process holds belongs to another container or a leaked
    context on the host, and every render dies at its first node with the card idle. `py/gpu_facts.py` measures it
    (foreign = used − ours; more than 4 GiB is `NOT-OURS`), discovery prints the numbers and fails the run on
    `NOT-OURS`, `boot.sh` logs them at every start, and podctl asks the same question over ssh BEFORE it uploads
    anything (`install`), after every `start`/`restart --wait`, and in `status`. Nothing inside the pod can free that
    memory: the remedy is a fresh container (stop and start; the leak may live on the machine), else a redeploy of the
    pod on the volume — `podctl deploy --like <pod> --wait`, a NEW pod cloned onto the same volume (image, GPU type,
    disk, ports, env, the base's boot as its start command; the volume's datacenter; never a templateId) that lands
    wherever the datacenter has the GPU free — else the host's support with the machine id.
12. **An unattended machine is a mode, not a fork; nothing is ever frozen** (2.1.0, 3.0.0). `BASE_NONINTERACTIVE=1`
    makes every prompt take its default. A baked image may carry the base built at the volume's own paths by a
    project's image generator (`BASE_SEED=1`: toolchain and packs, no models), parked on the container disk; a boot
    extension (`ext/`, §9) copies it onto an empty volume once, and the first install then takes everything to its
    newest like any machine. 3.0.0 retired the frozen mode (`BASE_PINNED`) and `COMFY_TAG`: they held a machine below
    its newest, which §0.3 forbids. The base ships neither the generator nor the extension.
13. **The model library may be SHARED by several machines** (2.4.0). `BASE_LIBRARY` names a store that more than
    one machine mounts at once, and with it set `models/` and ComfyUI's `output/` and `input/` live there instead of
    on the machine's own volume: a model is downloaded once for all of them rather than once each, and a file one
    machine writes is there for the next with no copy. ComfyUI's own `models/` becomes a LINK to it, not an extra
    search path, because several packs never ask `folder_paths` where their weights are and join
    `folder_paths.models_dir` with their own folder name instead. `user/` and `temp/` stay on the machine: `user/`
    holds the saved workflows the App view opens, and each machine carries only its own package. With no library set
    nothing changes and every path in this handbook reads as it always did. On Verda the store is an `NVMe_Shared`
    volume over NFS at `/mnt/comfy-library`, and a configured library is a hard requirement of the boot unit, so a
    missing mount means no server rather than a panel of empty dropdowns.

14. **The WHOLE root may be the shared store, and then a machine is just a GPU** (2.5.0). This is the RunPod shape
    carried to a host whose machines are virtual machines rather than containers. On RunPod a pod has no disk of its
    own: one network volume mounts at `/workspace` and holds `comfy-base/`, ComfyUI, the venv, `packages/` and the
    models, so the pod is disposable and the volume is the asset. With `BASE_VOLUME_SHARED=1` the same is true here,
    and a machine carries only the disk it boots from. Two things follow, and the base does both for you: ComfyUI's
    `user/` and `temp/` move to `BASE_LOCAL_STATE` on the machine itself, because saved workflows, frontend settings
    and scratch are per machine and two servers writing one `user/` tread on each other; and an install takes a
    lock on the store, because pip and uv write a venv in place and neither expects a second writer. RUNNING takes
    no lock at all, which is what makes several GPUs on one store safe: running only reads.
15. **The OS and the NVIDIA driver are at their newest too, and the base never reboots a machine itself** (3.0.0).
    The first stage of every run (`lib/15-system.sh`, before the store's lock and before the driver gate): `apt-get
    full-upgrade`, non-interactive, config files kept, needrestart told only to list (Ubuntu 24.04 would otherwise
    restart the boot unit mid-install). The driver is NVIDIA's own newest-tracking `nvidia-open` with `cuda-toolkit`,
    from NVIDIA's CUDA repository (added from its newest `cuda-keyring` when missing). A machine on another family
    (Verda's images ship Ubuntu's `nvidia-driver-580-server-open`) switches once, in ONE apt transaction that purges
    the old family's packages and prebuilt kernel modules, after stopping the boot unit (that machine's renders end
    there, as on any install's restart). After any kernel or driver install the nvidia module must exist for the newest
    kernel, or the run fails and advises no restart. A driver that changed stops the run before anything uses the GPU:
    "restart required: A -> B", and `podctl` prints the restart a person approves (Verda forbids an in-guest reboot).
    RunPod upgrades the container's packages only (the driver is the host's; `libnvidia-*` and `cuda-compat*` held). A
    host the base cannot upgrade (not apt, no root and no passwordless sudo) is warned about and the run goes on. A new
    Ubuntu release comes from deploying the provider's newest image, never an in-place release upgrade. Each machine
    writes `state/machines/<host>.env` (driver, CUDA, kernel) to the store, so an install that moves the shared venv
    to a new CUDA major names the machines that must run their own install before they render.
## 1. Hosts

The core of the base (`lib/`, `py/`, `suite/`) runs on any NVIDIA GPU on any Linux with one persistent volume root.
What differs between hosts is how a machine is created, reached and booted, and that lives in `hosts/<host>/`: the
host's provider (Mac-side, loaded by `podctl`), its startup script and its README. `hosts/README.md` is the matrix.

| Host | The machine | Volume root | The boot | Listen | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `runpod` | a container behind RunPod REST v1, sshd on a mapped port | `/workspace`, a network volume (`mount`) | the start command `podctl ensure` wraps around `boot.sh` | `0.0.0.0` (RunPod's HTTP proxy needs it) | proven |
| `verda` | a VM behind Verda's (DataCrunch's) REST API, `root@<ip>:22`; an OS volume that IS the image next time | `/workspace`, a block volume `startup.sh` formats once and mounts | `comfy-base-boot.service` | `127.0.0.1`, reached through `podctl tunnel` | proven (live account, 2026-09-17 and 2026-09-18) |
| `crusoe` | a VM with an every-boot startup script and a default-deny firewall, `ubuntu@<ip>:22` | `/workspace` (`mount`) | `comfy-base-boot.service` | `127.0.0.1`, through the tunnel | implemented, not yet run on a live account |
| `local` | an owned NVIDIA box, no API | a directory of your choosing (`BASE_VOLUME_KIND=dir`) | `comfy-base-boot.service`, installed by hand | `127.0.0.1` | a recipe |

**The four knobs** the core reads (`lib/00-env.sh`; `_base_host_resolve` settles them once every lib is loaded):

- `BASE_HOST`: `runpod | verda | crusoe | local | vm`. Explicit, else `runpod` when PID 1's environment carries
  `RUNPOD_POD_ID`, else read from `<volume>/comfy-base/state/host.env` (the driver writes it on `ensure` and
  `install`), else `vm` (a VM whose host is unknown). `boot.sh` answers the same question the same way (`boot_host`).
- `BASE_VOLUME`: the persistent root, `/workspace` by default. Every path the base keeps across a restart derives
  from it (`<volume>/comfy-base`, `<volume>/packages`, `<volume>/ComfyUI` when the tree is materialised).
- `BASE_VOLUME_KIND`: `mount` (the default: the root must be a mountpoint, never a directory on the container disk)
  or `dir` (the default when `BASE_HOST=local`: a directory on an owned box is the volume).
- `BASE_LISTEN`: the address ComfyUI and JupyterLab bind. `0.0.0.0` on RunPod because its HTTP proxy needs it,
  `127.0.0.1` everywhere else (Verda has no cloud firewall; the driver's ssh tunnel is the way in).

**How the driver picks a host.** `podctl [--provider <host>] <command>`, the flag before or after the verb; without
it `$PODCTL_PROVIDER`, else the one `brand.toml` host of the repository this base sits in (two brands on two hosts
make the flag required), else `runpod`. The provider answers where the machine is and how it starts, stops, clones
and hands its boot to the base; ssh, scp, upload, install, the lease, the tunnel and the GPU gate are the driver's and
the same on every host. The `Host <alias>` block the driver writes is the provider's name (`runpod`, `verda`,
`crusoe`) unless `PODCTL_HOST` overrides it, and the key is the provider's (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519` on RunPod,
`~/.ssh/verda_comfyui` on Verda). `ensure` and `install` write `state/host.env` on the machine (`BASE_HOST`,
`BASE_VOLUME`). An experimental provider says so once per run, on stderr. Credentials (RunPod's key, Verda's client
secret) are read by the provider from the environment or its tool's own config file and are never printed, logged or
placed in an argument. A host whose provider is not implemented (Crusoe today) is refused by name: `hosts/<host>/`
holds the interface and a recipe.

### 1.1 RunPod (proven)

**The one command (2.0.14).** Once a pod is reachable (`podctl ensure`), the whole documented sequence is
`uv run "base/comfyui-base/_build/pod/podctl.py" install <pod> --base --pkg "<package dir>"…`. For each item in order,
the local zip is checked current, the volume size is recorded for the disk gate, the zip is uploaded and extracted,
`--check` runs on the pod (non-zero stops everything), the real run goes detached (`BASE_RESTART=1` for a package;
`--comfy-ref <ref>` for a newer ComfyUI, that install only) and is polled until `STEP RC=`, the pod's `state/logs` are
copied to `<item>/_build/podruns/<date>/pod-logs/`, the summary block is printed, and a green run writes the pack records
it printed (each pack's HEAD) into the local script and rebuilds its zip. A run that upgraded the NVIDIA driver stops with
"restart required" and prints the `podctl restart` a person approves; the same install then continues. A red run stops with the console's path: the log is the deliverable, the fix loop
starts there. `podctl tunnel <pod>` is the one ssh session that forwards ports (8188, 8888, and 9199 and 11434 beside them:
the base runs no metrics exporter and no inference server, but a package may run one on the machine and reach
it on loopback, which is the shape a package takes when its point is that nothing leaves the box) for the canvas tools and
the browser. `podctl prune <pod>` lists the old-layout folders an earlier layout left under `/workspace/packages`
(`<Display Name>/` with a `<Display Name> Script.sh`, and `ComfyUI Base/`) and their workflow copies in ComfyUI's
browser; `--yes` removes exactly those, after the re-install has put the `<name>/` folders beside them. `--pkg` takes
the repository-relative package path (`<brand>/packages/<name>`) or a bare `<name>` that one brand has.

The REST key comes from `RUNPOD_API_KEY`, else `~/.runpod/config.toml` (written by `runpodctl config --apiKey=…`);
it rides a bearer header and is never printed.

```bash
uv run "base/comfyui-base/_build/pod/podctl.py" status <pod>     # facts; env NAMES and placeholder verdicts, never values; the GPU verdict
uv run "base/comfyui-base/_build/pod/podctl.py" deploy --like <pod> --wait   # a NEW pod cloned onto the same volume (rule 11's redeploy rung)
uv run "base/comfyui-base/_build/pod/podctl.py" ensure <pod>     # 22/tcp · PUBLIC_KEY = the Mac key · the start command · Host runpod · state/host.env
uv run "base/comfyui-base/_build/pod/podctl.py" upload <zip>...  # to /workspace/packages, size + sha256 checked both sides
uv run "base/comfyui-base/_build/pod/podctl.py" stop|start|restart <pod> --wait
```

`ensure` sets the pod's start command to `bash -c "if [ -x /workspace/comfy-base/boot.sh ]; then exec bash …; fi;
<sshd bootstrap>; exec <the image's own entry>"` (the image's entry read from Docker Hub's registry; `--entry` for
private images). Before the base is installed that boots the image as it was plus sshd; afterwards it boots the base.
`stop`/`start --wait` rewrite the `Host runpod` block, because RunPod maps a new public port on every start. ComfyUI
(8188) and JupyterLab (8888) are also on RunPod's HTTP proxy ports, which is why this host binds `0.0.0.0`. Fallback
when the API is not available: the JupyterLab terminal on port 8888, where `bash lib/boot.sh --print-sshd-bootstrap`
prints the sshd snippet to paste.

### 1.2 Verda

Proven on a live account, 2026-09-17 and 2026-09-18 (2.5.3); the driver no longer warns. What those runs answered,
and the recipe in full, is `hosts/verda/README.md`; the shape:

- **Credentials:** a client id and secret (OAuth2 client credentials, exchanged for a bearer token), from
  `VERDA_CLIENT_ID` + `VERDA_CLIENT_SECRET` or `~/.verda/credentials` (mode 600). The key is `~/.ssh/verda_comfyui`;
  `ensure` registers its `.pub` with Verda when no registered key equals it.
- **The machine:** an RTX PRO 6000 class instance type (`VERDA_INSTANCE_TYPE`), the `ubuntu-24.04-cuda-13.0-open-docker`
  image, one location for the instance and every volume, and ONE data volume named `<machine>-data` beside it.
  `hosts/verda/startup.sh` (registered as `comfy-base-startup`, and run again by `ensure` over ssh) finds it as the one
  unmounted `/dev/vd[b-z]`, formats it ext4 only when blank, mounts it at `/workspace` by UUID with `nofail`, and
  installs `comfy-base-boot.service`.
- **The sequence:** `podctl --provider verda pods`, `start <os volume id>` (a new instance from that volume, data
  volumes attached), then `ensure <instance id>`, `install <instance id> --base`, `tunnel <instance id>`.
- **Stop and start are delete and redeploy.** A shut-down Verda instance still bills the GPU, so `stop` deletes the
  instance keeping every volume, and `start <os volume id>` redeploys from the OS volume (the disk, the packages, the
  unit and the fstab line all come back). The public ip and the instance id both change on every start; the provider
  rewrites the `Host verda` block, and the OS volume id is the stable handle of a machine.
- **No cloud firewall:** every port bound on `0.0.0.0` is on the internet at once, so the base binds loopback here and
  the tunnel is the way in. The balance is prepaid and at zero every volume goes to the trash, with 96 hours to restore.

The first live pass must settle the ssh user, whether the startup script re-runs on a redeploy, and when `ip`
populates (the README's numbered list); the EXPERIMENTAL notice comes off only when all three are known.

### 1.3 Crusoe (implemented, not yet run live)

A VM with an every-boot startup script and a default-deny firewall, `ubuntu` as the login user, `/workspace` as a
mounted block volume and the base's systemd unit as the boot. `hosts/crusoe/provider.py` is a signed REST client
carrying the whole Provider interface, and `suite/test_crusoe.py` drives it against a fake API that verifies every
signature; no call has reached the real service yet, so the driver still says EXPERIMENTAL. Three things differ
from Verda and shape the code: `stop` is a real stop (a stopped VM bills its disks only), the public ip is dynamic
and changes on every start, and the startup script is a create-time field that cannot be changed through the API,
so `ensure` ships the current one over ssh. The recipe, and what a first live run should report, is
`hosts/crusoe/README.md`.

### 1.4 local (a recipe)

An owned NVIDIA box: no API, no driver. `BASE_HOST=local` makes `BASE_VOLUME_KIND=dir`, so `BASE_VOLUME` is a
directory of your choosing; the base binds loopback; `base_boot_install` writes `comfy-base-boot.service` beside
`boot.sh` and installs it itself when it runs as root on a live systemd host, else it prints the `cp` and
`systemctl enable` to run. The recipe is `hosts/local/README.md`.

## 2. Step one on a fresh machine

```bash
cd <volume>/packages
python3 -m zipfile -e "comfyui-base.zip" .      # slim images have no unzip
bash "comfyui-base/comfyui-base-script.sh"
```

The base's zip is `comfyui-base.zip`, one artefact for every host. The script copies itself to `<volume>/comfy-base/`
and re-executes from there, then: resolves the host (§1), refuses a volume root that is not a mountpoint (unless
`BASE_VOLUME_KIND=dir`), upgrades the OS and the NVIDIA driver (§0.15), finds or materialises the canonical tree
(§0.2), reads the tokens (§0.9), moves ComfyUI to its newest release, gates on the version floor, moves the six shared
packs (rgthree, KJNodes, VideoHelperSuite, cg-use-everywhere, ComfyUI-Manager, ComfyUI-advanced-model-manager) to their
HEAD, builds or adopts the venv with every present pack's requirements at their newest (§0.3), sets the launch-arg hygiene, installs `boot.sh` + the boot unit on a VM host + the tools venv
(JupyterLab) + `state/boot.env`, writes its ledger entry, and prints the launch line. `--check` is the dry run (on a
volume with no tree it stops after "would materialise"). `bash base.sh status` lists every package installed on the
machine and, when the driver wrote one, prints `state/host.env`.

On a machine from a baked image step one has already happened inside the image: a boot extension (`ext/*.sh`, §9)
copies the seed onto the empty volume on the first boot, and the project's packages install themselves from their
zips with `BASE_YES=1 BASE_NONINTERACTIVE=1 BASE_NO_SUITE=1`, taking everything to its newest. The base ships no such
extension.

## 3. Step two: a workflow package

```bash
cd <volume>/packages && mkdir -p "<name>" && python3 -m zipfile -e "<name>-<host>.zip" "<name>" && BASE_RESTART=1 bash "<name>/<name>-script.sh"
```

A package zip is `<name>-<host>.zip`, the host being its brand's `brand.toml` (§4; `runpod` for a package with no
brand above it). It is flat and extracts into its own folder (`podctl install` does this): two packages both ship
`suite.py` and `pytest.ini`, and flat extraction let the second overwrite the first's (2.0.17).
Same six forms everywhere: install · `--check` · `--latest` (3.0.0: the same as a plain install; kept for old callers) ·
`test [tier]` · `rescue` · `help`, plus the package's own `PKG_COMMANDS`. `BASE_RESTART=1` makes the summary's smoke,
combos and suite run against the server this run installed.

## 4. The package contract

A thin `<name>-script.sh` (60–200 lines) declares, then sources the base and calls `base_main "$@"`:

- Required: `PKG_NAME PKG_ID PKG_VERSION BASE_MIN WF_NAME COMFY_MIN PACKS MODELS`. A package whose `BASE_MIN` is newer
  than the installed base is refused, both versions named. `WF_NAME=""` is allowed (2.2.0): a package with no workflow
  yet; the packager ships no workflow member, and the sync, smoke and combo stages report "no workflow" and pass.
- The brand: a package belongs to the brand whose `brand.toml` sits above it (`<brand>/brand.toml`, with `name` and
  `host = runpod | verda | crusoe | local`). `py/brand.py` reads it; the packager names the zip `<name>-<host>.zip`
  by it and the driver takes its default provider from it. A tree with no `brand.toml` above it (an extracted zip, a
  flat checkout) is host `runpod` by default.
- The brand's families: `<brand>/families.txt` beside `brand.toml`, one family spelling per line (`#` comments), is
  the brand's list of `Family` folders. The base's unit tier, run from the brand repository, checks every package's
  rows against it (`test_unit_every_package_family_is_in_its_brands_families_file`); on the machine a Family is
  checked for shape only, so no zip carries the list. A brand without the file skips the check.
- Optional: `WF_VERSION_KEY` (the `extra` key carrying the workflow's version; default `package_version`),
  `DRIVER_MIN SUPERSEDED LEGACY_DIRS DROPPED_PACKS TOKENS PIP_EXTRA HYGIENE_ARGS HYGIENE_ARGS_REMOVE LOADER_CATS
  PKG_COMMANDS PKG_IMPORT_CHECK PKG_NO_SUITE ZIP_EXTRA`. `PKG_NO_SUITE=1` is how a package that ships no `suite.py`
  says so: the run's test stage notes it, and `verify.sh` passes the package as "no suite, declared". `LOADER_CATS`
  rows (`NodeType|library category`) extend the base's map of loader node types to library folders (`lib/60-sync.sh`
  covers ComfyUI's core loaders and the shared packs'); a package whose own pack loads models declares its loaders here.
- Hooks, called if defined, dry-run aware via `$BASE_DRY`: `pkg_pre_venv pkg_post_venv pkg_pre_models
  pkg_post_models pkg_hygiene pkg_import_check pkg_post_install pkg_summary`, and `pkg_cmd_<name>` per
  `PKG_COMMANDS` row `name|function|help`. A failing hook fails the run. A package whose `pkg_post_venv` compiles
  something (SageAttention) is listed for re-run after any venv rebuild.
- `PACKS` rows: `dir|url|sha|cnr_id|why`: `sha` is 40 hex, the last-tested record (every run takes the pack to its
  remote's HEAD); a base pack may not be redeclared; two packages naming one pack from two URLs is an error naming
  both, and two different records for one pack is a note.
- `MODELS` rows: `category|Family|Purpose|file|url|bytes|note|alts` — `bytes` exact (`base.sh gen-models <dir>`
  fills it from the Hub); `url` is a Hugging Face `resolve` URL, a GitHub URL (a release asset), `LOCAL`, or
  `hf://owner/repo` with `file` ending in `/` for a repo snapshot; no other host is accepted; `alts` are legacy
  basenames the index may adopt. `base.sh stamp-models <pkg dir>` writes ComfyUI's own `models` array into the
  shipped workflow from these rows (`--check` compares).
- The workflow beside the script must carry `extra.<WF_VERSION_KEY> == PKG_VERSION`; the run refuses a mismatch.
- Helpers a hook may use: `ok miss err note warn hdr would todo`, `base_mkdir`, `base_run` (dry-run aware),
  `_base_yaml_register <section> <key> <path>`, `base_build_sageattention` (SageAttention 2 from source for this GPU's sm,
  dry-run aware; `SAGE_REF` names a branch or tag, default main; rebuilt whenever its full cache key moves; 2.0.22, 3.0.0), `$COMFY $CN $M $VENV $PY $PKG_DIR $BASE_STATE`.
  A hook that changed something the running server must reload appends its reason to `PKG_RESTART_WHY` (an array);
  the run's restart hand-off then restarts the server (`BASE_RESTART=1`) or prints the launch line with those reasons,
  never a green summary on a stale server.

Suites ship as `suite.py` + `pytest.ini` beside the script and load the base's plugin (`-p basetest`), which gives
`load_package`, `active_loaders`, `manifest_covers_active_loaders`, `brand_families`, `fake_pod` (layouts `official`,
`community`, `bare`, `volume`), `run_script`, `boot_stubs`, `boot_fake_pod`, `tree_hash`, `code_only` and the per-tier
table. `bash "<name>-script.sh" test` auto-detects the testbed and its server on 8199, or on the port a running testbed
recorded in `.testbed-server.port` beside `testbed.sh` (2.2.0: `_base_use_testbed` and `verify.sh` both read it, so a
brand whose testbed runs elsewhere needs no env var); `BASE_NODE_SRC` / `BASE_SERVER` override; the runner hands the
suite `BASE_COMFY` and `BASE_VENV`.

Since 2.6.0 the testbed lives in **two possible places**, checked in this order: `<base>/testbed`, provisioned by the
`testbed.sh` that ships in this repository, and `base/testbed` beside `base/comfyui-base` in a brand repository. A root
is taken whole — the port file is read from the same root that supplied the tree, never from the other one. Before
2.6.0 only the second existed, so a clone of this repository on its own could never run the `comfyui` tier; it skipped
by name forever, which is a poor thing to hand someone who forked the repository to work on it. `bash testbed.sh
--server` provisions an upstream ComfyUI at its newest release tag (or `COMFY_REF`) plus the base's own packs at their
HEAD (derived from `list-packs`, never hand-listed), every requirement at its newest through `py/reqlift.py`, on the
newest Python, and starts it on CPU. It is several GB and gitignored.

## 5. Pipeline (install)

init (env · log · volume check · discover, or materialise the tree · declarations + `BASE_MIN` gate · banner) → system
(the OS and the NVIDIA driver at their newest; a new driver stops here with "restart required") → driver gate → the
store's install lock → require workflow → tokens (validated; a rejected one stops here) → update ComfyUI → version gate →
consolidate strays (the volume only) → packs git (every pack to its HEAD) → the venv snapshot → `pkg_pre_venv` → venv →
`pkg_post_venv` → packs pip (the derived, pin-free set) → Comfy MCP → newest (every package still behind forced to its
newest) → `pkg_pre_models` →
models (one index over the volume; move on the same device else copy-verify-delete; hf-xet for the Hub, curl for
GitHub; disk gate first) → prune (one prompt; `unclaimed` reported) → sync workflow paths → `pkg_post_models` →
import check → hygiene → boot (boot.sh, tools venv, boot.env) → ledger → restart hand-off (or `BASE_RESTART=1`) →
smoke → combos → the package's suite → `pkg_post_install` → summary (exit 0, or 1 when anything failed).

## 6. Any host: the contract

| Fact | On every host |
|---|---|
| The volume | the volume root, `BASE_VOLUME` (`/workspace` on the three clouds; your directory on an owned box): the only filesystem a stop/start keeps; a root that is not a mountpoint is refused unless `BASE_VOLUME_KIND=dir` |
| The tree | recorded in `state/boot.env`, else an existing volume tree, else materialised at `<volume>/ComfyUI` (§0.2) |
| The venv | `$COMFY/.venv-cu130`, interpreter under `<volume>/comfy-base/python` |
| Packs | the base's six + each package's, cloned into `$COMFY/custom_nodes`; other directories there are left alone but their requirements go into the venv |
| Models | scanned and consolidated on the volume only; the container disk is never read (it is gone at the next start) |
| Launch flags | `state/comfyui_args.txt` (§0.10) |
| Tokens | the machine's own environment, then `state/tokens.env` (§0.9) |
| The host | `BASE_HOST`, `BASE_VOLUME`, `BASE_VOLUME_KIND`, `BASE_LISTEN` (§1); `state/host.env` when the driver wrote it |
| The boot | `boot.sh`: PID 1 via podctl's start command on RunPod, the process of `comfy-base-boot.service` on a VM host: sshd (keys only) → JupyterLab (base tools venv, `JUPYTER_TOKEN`/`JUPYTER_PASSWORD`) → boot extensions (§9) → ComfyUI (base venv, base line, bound to `BASE_LISTEN`) → sleep forever |
| Restart | `_base_pids_from_table`: a python running `main.py` from the tree, or naming a `…/ComfyUI/main.py`; never PID 1 |
| Uploads | `<volume>/packages/` (`podctl upload`); each package extracted into its own folder there |
| A baked image | a project's own (the base ships no generator): the base built at these very paths and parked on the container disk; a boot extension copies it onto an empty volume once and installs the project's packages, pinned and non-interactive (§0.12) |

**RunPod, three image families:** RunPod's ComfyUI (tree `/workspace/runpod-slim/ComfyUI`,
`runpod-slim/comfyui_args.txt` imported once, sshd native); community templates that keep the code on the container
disk (`/ComfyUI`) with the persist dirs at `/workspace/ComfyUI`, so the base materialises the code beside them (no sshd;
JupyterLab unauthenticated unless `JUPYTER_TOKEN`); a bare GPU image (everything materialised). `/workspace` is a
network filesystem: `df` reports the shared pool, so the disk gate says when it cannot verify headroom. Slim images
have no `unzip`; `python3 -m zipfile -e` does the job.

**A VM host (Verda, Crusoe):** a fresh OS image with a driver and Python 3, and an empty block volume the host's
startup script formats (ext4, only when blank) and mounts at `/workspace` by UUID; the base's `comfy-base-boot.service`
runs `boot.sh` at every boot (`RequiresMountsFor=/workspace`, and it sleeps rather than fails while the base is not
installed yet). Everything else is the bare-image case: the tree, the venv, the packs are all materialised on the
volume, and the machine is reached through the driver's tunnel because the base binds loopback.

**An owned box (local):** `BASE_HOST=local BASE_VOLUME=<dir>`; the directory is the volume (`BASE_VOLUME_KIND=dir`),
the unit is installed by hand or by the base when it runs as root, sshd is whatever the box already runs, and nothing
listens beyond loopback.

## 7. State on the machine

`<volume>/comfy-base/` holds the library (`base.sh lib/ py/ suite/ hosts/`, verified against `MANIFEST.sha256` on
every source), `boot.sh`, `comfy-base-boot.service` (the unit's text, always written; installed under
`/etc/systemd/system` on a VM host), `ext/` when a project's image put extensions there (§9), `state/` (`boot.env`,
`host.env` (`BASE_HOST`, `BASE_VOLUME`, written by the driver), `comfyui_args.txt`, `tokens.env` 0600,
`constraints-torch.txt`, `boot-facts.txt`, `volume.env` on RunPod, `gpu.lease`, `packages/<id>.manifest`, `logs/`: install
logs, `boot_<ts>.log`, `comfyui.log`, `jupyter.log`), `python/` (the uv-managed interpreter), `tools/` (JupyterLab) and
`dead-venvs/` (quarantined venvs). A package manifest records its packs, model claims, superseded names and hooks;
`bash base.sh status` renders them and prints `state/host.env` when there is one; `bash base.sh latest` asks every
pinned pack's remote what HEAD is now.

## 8. Tests

Tiers: `unit` (source contracts on the library, podctl and the RunPod provider against a fake RunPod REST server,
boot.sh with stubs, the host layer in `suite/test_hosts.py` (the four knobs, the boot's host detection and extension
seam, the systemd unit, brand.toml, the driver's provider binding), the Verda provider against a fake REST server in
`suite/test_verda.py`, the derive kit in `suite/test_derive.py`, the canvas kit on a synthetic workflow in
`suite/test_canvas.py`), `install` (the stub package under `_build/stub` run end to end against fake pods of every
layout, offline), `comfyui` (the repo testbed), `runpod` / `gpu` (pod only: the venv the boot activates, the running
server on it, PID 1 = boot.sh with sshd and JupyterLab answering; the last two skip until the stop/start hands the boot
over), `bare` (the shell sources without a machine).

```bash
cd base/comfyui-base && bash base.sh test                                                        # every tier
uv run --no-project --with pytest python base/comfyui-base/_build/rehearse.py <brand>/packages/<name> --layout official|community|bare|volume
bash base/comfyui-base/_build/verify.sh [<brand>/packages/<name>...]                            # zip current, suite from the repo, suite from the zip
```

The rehearsal unpacks the shipped zips, runs the two steps on a fake pod of that layout, then boots it through
`comfy-base/boot.sh` with stubs; ALL OK means the zips are ready to upload. Standalone (this base as its own
repository), `rehearse.py stub --layout volume` uses the fixture package.

### 8.1 The canvas kit — what every package's canvas is tested with

The same shape as the installer: the base owns the machinery, a package owns its tables. Each piece was written
against the real frontend and a real defect.

| What | Where | Package side |
|---|---|---|
| graph helpers (`byid` through subgraphs, `links`, the frontend's bypass resolver `resolve_frontend`), geometry (`nbound`, rgthree's `membership`), the size floor, `structure_sha`, `note_height`, `Budgets`, `CanvasSpec` | `py/canvas.py` | `from canvas import ...` in suite.py |
| 41 generic tests: the `uiux` budgets (collisions, spacing, grid, notes and labels fit, LOD cliff, fill, bloat, flow, palette, titles, reading order), the `snapshot` tier (the real frontend), the shape-only `config` guards (zip = shipped pair, versions agree, tier gates, handbook numbers, packs pinned) | `py/canvastest.py` | `CANVAS = CanvasSpec(...)` then `from canvastest import *`; markers `uiux`, `snapshot`, `config` in pytest.ini |
| `snapshot.py` (photograph + `sizes.json`), `render.py` (offline review, `--review`), `page.py` (before/after), `panels.py` (every rgthree row clicked in the real frontend), `probe.py` (`graphToPrompt` per state), `canvaslayout.py` (the layout engine) | `_build/canvas/` (repo tooling, not in the zip) | every tool takes `--pkg <package dir>`; `<pkg>/_build/layout.py` = tables + `run(globals())` |

Adopting a package: (1) put its constants in suite.py as literals and declare `CANVAS = CanvasSpec(user_facing=...,
markers=..., cuda_only=..., start_card=..., display="1512x982@2", nest=..., partial=..., tier_gates=...)`, then
`from canvastest import *` before the suite's marker loop; (2) `uv run "base/comfyui-base/_build/canvas/snapshot.py" --pkg <dir>`
once, with the testbed server up, for its `_build/sizes.json`; (3) `python3 "base/comfyui-base/_build/canvas/render.py" --pkg <dir>
--review` and fix what the budgets find -- for a canvas that never had them, expect off-grid boxes, frames too big for
what they hold and a saved view under the LOD cliff; `canvaslayout.py` with a tables file is how a package relays
itself out.

## 9. Boot extensions

`boot.sh` runs sshd, JupyterLab and the saved tokens, then sources every `ext/*.sh` it finds, in name order, before it
starts ComfyUI (`boot_extensions`, 2.2.0). It looks in two places and takes the first that has any: `$BOOT_HOME/ext`
(that is `<volume>/comfy-base/ext`, the installed base on the volume), else `ext/` beside `boot.sh` itself. The second
place exists for a baked image's FIRST boot: the volume is still empty then, so the only copy that can run is the
seed's own, beside the seed's `boot.sh` on the container disk, and copying the seed onto the volume is exactly what
such an extension does. An extension is a bash file sourced into the boot's own shell, so it sees `BOOT_HOME`,
`BOOT_VOLUME`, `BASE_HOST` and `BASE_LISTEN` and must not `exit`; the boot logs each file it sourced, or "no
extensions" when neither place has one.

The base ships no extension. A project's image adds its own stages this way (copying its seed onto an empty volume,
provisioning, a status page), in the project's own repository.

## 9.1 Comfy MCP (the agent's way in)

`comfy-mcp` is a stdio MCP server wrapping `comfy-cli`. Since 2.7.0 the base installs it into the run's venv
(`lib/45-mcp.sh`), beside ComfyUI itself, and `podctl mcp <machine>` writes the client configuration.
`BASE_MCP=0` skips the install; the stage never fails a run.

There are two transports and the difference is not cosmetic:

| | where comfy-mcp runs | what works |
|---|---|---|
| `--over ssh` (default) | on the machine | everything: `install_node`, `search_models`, `get_logs`, `fetch_outputs`, `launch_comfyui`, and the run tools |
| `--over tunnel` | on your Mac, reaching `COMFYUI_URL` through `podctl tunnel` | the run tools only |

The lifecycle and discovery tools need the tree, and the tree is on the machine — which is why the server is
installed there and ssh is the default. The ssh transport passes `ClearAllForwardings=yes`: the `Host` block
`podctl ssh-config` writes carries four `LocalForward` lines, and a second session binding them while a tunnel
holds them prints warnings onto the very stdio channel MCP is speaking. The tunnel transport takes the alias's
own local port (`tunnel_locals`), so two machines never point at one tunnel.

**What this repository does NOT ship.** No `.mcp.json` is committed. Comfy-Org's `comfy skills install` writes
the client configuration for Claude Code, Cursor and `AGENTS.md` at user scope, and their `Comfy-Org/comfy-skills`
marketplace calls itself the single source of truth for the installer and the MCP server; comfy-mcp itself had two
releases in its first two months. A second, committed source of truth for a thing that young, owned by someone
else, would drift within weeks and would prompt every person who clones this repository to enable a server that
cannot work until they have a tunnel up. So the local case belongs to upstream, and what stays here is the case
upstream does not cover: a machine the base provisioned on a rented GPU, which is neither "ComfyUI on your
machine" nor Comfy Cloud. `podctl mcp` writes that file, and `.gitignore` keeps it out of the tree because it
names one machine and one operator's paths.

**`COMFY_BIN`.** comfy-mcp is a wrapper: its discovery and lifecycle tools shell out to comfy-cli, which it
finds through `COMFY_BIN` or `PATH`. An MCP client is usually launched by a GUI, whose `PATH` is not your
shell's, so `PATH` is the thing not to rely on. `podctl mcp` therefore names the binary: over ssh it is the
`comfy` beside the machine's `comfy-mcp`, and over the tunnel it is this machine's, when one can be found (it
says so when none can). MEASURED 2026-09-19 against a live ComfyUI: without it, `server_info` answers "Error
executing tool server_info"; with it, it answers with the interpreter, the config path and the bound workspace.

**Telemetry.** `comfy-cli` depends on `mixpanel` and `posthog`, and rule 9 says the outbound hosts are an
allowlist and nothing is uploaded. That wheel is not our source, so the allowlist test cannot see it. Three
things are done instead, in order of how much they can be relied on: `DO_NOT_TRACK` and `COMFY_NO_TELEMETRY`
are exported before anything from the wheel runs — comfy-cli honours the `DO_NOT_TRACK` convention by never
importing its telemetry extension at all, so this is the code path not loading rather than a request to be
quiet; the same two go into the boot environment, because a machine that reboots must come back as quiet as it
was installed; and `comfy tracking disable` writes the config file (`~/.config/comfy-cli/config.ini` on Linux)
for any invocation that somehow arrives without the environment. The suite asserts the first two.

## 10. Record

- 3.0.3: renders stay on the store, and a machine runs one ComfyUI. Both measured on a Verda machine on a shared store
  (`BASE_VOLUME_SHARED=1`). First, `comfyui_args.txt` still named `--output-directory` and `--input-directory` on the
  old library mount: 2.5.2 stopped using a library under a shared root, but the hygiene only ever ensured those flags
  and never took them back, so ComfyUI made the old mount point on the OS disk and wrote every render and upload there.
  Without a library the hygiene now removes a value that is not on the store (a package's own `HYGIENE_ARGS` choice
  stands), and the launch line, which the boot also uses, leaves off one that sits on the OS disk while the store is a
  mount of its own, and never creates it. Second, `BASE_RESTART=1` started ComfyUI detached (ppid 1), outside
  `comfy-base-boot.service`'s cgroup, so a later `systemctl restart comfy-base-boot` started a second one beside it (the
  old one kept :8188 and 34 GB of VRAM). `_base_restart_comfy` is now the one way to restart: through the unit where it
  is enabled and the caller is not inside it, directly elsewhere; and `boot_comfy` stops any ComfyUI it did not start
  before starting its own. The process matcher moved to `lib/85-launch.sh`, which gives the boot's wait the liveness
  check it lacked (before, it declared a healthy start dead after 2 s). Exercised by the suite only (macOS and Python
  3.14); not yet on a live machine.

- 3.0.2: every `HTTPError` the host providers and `py/smoke.py` read is closed. 3.0.0's test runner takes the newest
  Python uv has instead of 3.12, and on Python 3.14 an HTTPError that is read but never closed is a `ResourceWarning`
  when it is collected; with warnings as errors, the repository's CI went red on 3.0.0 (13 failures, all this one
  cause, each reported against whichever test was running when it was collected). The suite passes under 3.14 now.

- 3.0.1: a SageAttention build for a list of architectures serves each GPU in the list. An image built with no GPU
  stamps its build for `SAGE_ARCHS="9.0;12.0"`, and the machine it serves computed its key from `sm_120`, so the two
  never matched and every first install rebuilt SageAttention (10-20 minutes) from the very source, Python and torch the
  image already carried. The stamp, and a cached wheel, now count as current when they are the same commit, Python and
  torch and their list holds this GPU's sm; a GPU the list does not hold still builds. Measured by the session that
  adapts a baked-image consumer to 3.0.0.

- 3.0.0: always the newest, for everything the base installs, on every run and every host (§0.3). ComfyUI stays on its
  newest release, with `COMFY_REF` (`podctl install --comfy-ref`) as the opt-in for something newer; a pack is at its
  remote's HEAD on every run (a row's sha is the last-tested record); every Python package is at its newest through
  `py/reqlift.py` and uv's overrides (measured on 2026-09-25: ComfyUI v0.37.2 plus 27 pack requirement files resolve on
  Python 3.14, the frontend lifted from 1.52.7 to 1.54.7, protobuf forced from 5.29.6 to 7.36.2 past a cap that
  `google-generativeai` 0.8.6 still imports under); torch follows the newest CUDA build the driver runs through uv's
  `--torch-backend=auto`; the OS and the NVIDIA driver (NVIDIA's `nvidia-open`, a one-time switch from another family in
  a single transaction) are upgraded first, and a new driver stops the run before the GPU is used, asking for a restart a
  person approves. The Verda startup script registered on an account is replaced when it differs (`ensure`) and never
  attached when stale. RETIRED, each because it held something below its newest: `BASE_PINNED`, `COMFY_TAG`,
  `BASE_LATEST` (`--latest` is a plain run), `SAGE_WHEEL`, a 40-hex `SAGE_REF`, `BASE_FORCE_SELF`, `podctl --no-latest`.
  A baked-image consumer that set `BASE_PINNED`/`COMFY_TAG` now gets a machine that upgrades at its first install.
  `podctl install` no longer rewrites a shared-root machine's `host.env` as a library machine (it read an attached
  shared volume as a library and dropped `BASE_VOLUME_SHARED=1`): the Verda provider asks the machine what `/workspace` is.
  The rehearsal's fake machine now runs the package's own `COMFY_MIN` (it was always 0.34.7) and carries the package's
  vendored node packs (it copied only top-level files), both measured by a consumer whose suite failed only there.
  2.12.3's `_base_venv_reconcile` is superseded: nothing installs an upstream file one at a time any more (the overshoot
  it repaired cannot happen in one resolve), and re-resolving `pip check` conflicts would undo a deliberate force; a
  force its holder refuses at import (transformers with huggingface-hub 2.0.0) is taken back by `py/holders.py` instead.

- 2.12.3: the venv's requirements are made to agree after every pip half, at their newest. On a Verda machine with a
  reused venv, `--latest` ended at the import check: `transformers` 5.17.0, the newest release, requires
  `huggingface-hub<2.0`, and the per-pack loop had taken the hub to 2.0.0. `pip install --upgrade -r <file>` always
  takes a requirement the file names to its newest, several packs name a bare `huggingface_hub`, and pip does not
  resolve against what is installed outside the request; it only warns. `_base_venv_reconcile` now runs after the
  per-pack loop (every run, reuse included) and after the build's installs: `pip check`, then both sides of every
  conflict in ONE `pip install --upgrade` under the torch constraint, so the resolver lands on the newest set that
  agrees (that night, transformers 5.17.0 with huggingface-hub 1.33.0). No pin is written. A conflict pip cannot
  resolve is reported and left to the import check, which stays the gate. Four unit tests feed it canned
  `pip check` text.
- 2.12.2: `comfyui-base.zip` carries `LICENSE`. It never did: the packager's member list named five files and the
  licence was not one of them, so every copy of the zip went out without the notice MIT asks to travel with it.
  The zip is exactly the copy a project built on the base hands to its own users (a workflow package's buyers
  install it as step one), so the gap reached every one of them. `suite/test_unit.py` asserts the notice is in
  the extracted zip, beside the manifest check that already proves every shipped file is listed. Step one's
  copy list (`lib/95-summary.sh`) had to learn the file too, or the install failed its own manifest check; a new
  test holds the packager's members and the installer's list together, since they are kept by hand in two places.
  Also: `suite/test_podctl.py`'s fake-RunPod CLI call inherited the session's `PODCTL_*`, so a workspace exporting
  `PODCTL_PROVIDER=verda` sent it, authenticated, to the LIVE Verda API. It strips them now; a test reaches only
  its own fake server.

- 2.12.1: a security review of 2.12.0, and it found two real things, both in the same eight lines. The Jupyter
  token was interpolated into the ssh COMMAND, and sshd runs a non-login remote command as `bash -c '<cmd>'`, so
  it landed in the machine's `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`, world-readable on Linux, and in `ps` on the Mac. The code
  then wrote the file 0600, which protects the value at rest while having published it in the process table on
  the way there. `lib/boot.sh` states the rule for this exact secret and `suite/test_unit.py` asserts it: the
  token rides the environment, never argv. It goes on stdin now, and `ssh_run` grew an `input` parameter to make
  that possible for any secret.
  The same line also passed the drop-in body as printf's FORMAT string. MEASURED: a token of `ab%sc` was written
  as `abc`, `100%done` as `1000one`, and `tok%` truncated the file. printf failing inside a pipeline leaves the
  pipeline's status as tee's, so the `&&` chain carried on and `ensure` reported the token written while the
  machine held a different one. There is no attacker here, the token is the operator's own, but the failure was
  silent and that is worse than loud.
  Also hardened while in there: a public address from the API is parsed with `ipaddress.ip_address()` before it
  reaches the operator's `~/.ssh/config`, where a newline would have become an ssh directive. That needs the API
  to lie, which is a high bar, but it is one line.
  And the signing test stopped being circular before the review reached it: it recomputed the expected signature
  with the same formula the code uses, which proves only that the code agrees with itself. Two golden vectors are
  pinned as literals now, with an assertion that at least one of them contains a `-` or `_`, because standard and
  url-safe base64 differ in exactly two characters and a signature containing neither cannot tell them apart.

- 2.12.0: Crusoe has a driver. `hosts/crusoe/provider.py` was 144 lines in which every method raised, so of the
  four hosts it was the only one actually broken: the machine side has been complete for a while, but nothing on
  a Mac could find, reach or move a VM. It is a signed REST client now with the whole Provider interface behind
  it. The signing was the part worth getting right and the part with no live 200 to check against: the prose
  docs' own worked example does not reproduce under any reading, so it is built from two of Crusoe's own
  implementations instead, which do agree (client-go auth/v1/auth.go and the Python in
  crusoe-registry-token-rotator), and the suite asserts it against that formula rather than against a constant.
  The fake API verifies every signature, so a provider that stops signing fails here rather than in production.
  Three things are not Verda and shape the code. `stop` is a real stop, because a stopped Crusoe VM keeps its
  disks and its id and bills the disks only, where a shut-down Verda instance still bills the GPU and is
  therefore deleted. The public ip is dynamic, so every lifecycle call rewrites the Host block rather than only
  the first. And the startup script is a create-time field that cannot be changed through the API and runs on
  every boot, so `ensure` ships the current `hosts/crusoe/startup.sh` over ssh and re-runs it, which is the only
  way to move an existing machine forward. `deploy` detaches the disk before creating the clone and passes it in
  the create body rather than attaching afterwards, because a VM that boots without its disk sends the startup
  script into a 15 minute wait for one. `ensure` also writes the JUPYTER_TOKEN systemd drop-in, without which
  `podctl jupyter` reports no token on this host forever and reads as a broken command.
  Two defects in the stub went with it: `record_volume` took no `env` keyword while `PodIO.upload` passes one,
  which was a TypeError escaping the PodctlError handler as a traceback rather than a diagnosis; and a lifecycle
  call that answered FAILED immediately was polled 120 times anyway instead of failing at once.
  `experimental` stays True. Implementing the methods does not earn its removal, a live account does, and this
  is exactly where Verda sat before its first live run corrected three things the documentation implied.

- 2.11.1: the repository names no brand but its own maintainer. The runtime was already clean and a foreign
  brand already built and gated green, but `CLAUDE.md` named two consumer repositories, three Record entries
  named a foreign brand, two machine aliases and a workflow product, and two test comments named a consumer's
  layout and a package. None of it was load-bearing and all of it told a reader this was somebody's private
  tool. Only the attribution survives, in `LICENSE` and the README. The brand-guard test changed shape too: it
  used to forbid a list of two organisation names, which meant citing the very organisations the rule exists to
  keep out, and would have gone stale as consumers change. It asserts the invariant now - every `packages/` glob
  in `testbed.sh` is anchored on a variable, never on a literal directory - which is what the original leak
  violated, catches any future one, and names nobody. Verified against the 2.6.0 leak verbatim and a synthetic
  new brand: both caught; variable-anchored globs and comments: clean.
  The README also says what this is for someone who will never write a package: ComfyUI at its newest release
  tag plus six pinned packs including ComfyUI-Manager, no model weights, bring any workflow. That is what most
  people want from it, and the front page led with the package contract instead.

- 2.11.0: the driver stops knowing one brand's machines. `TUNNEL_LOCAL` was a hard-coded map of three
  `verda-*` aliases belonging to the repository's own maintainer, and `tunnel_locals` read a machine's port
  offset out of it. Everybody else's fleet fell through to 0, so their second machine silently shared 8188
  with their first, and the only way to fix it was to edit the base - the one thing a consumer repository must
  never do. The offset is a fact about somebody's fleet, not about the base or the host, so it comes from
  `$PODCTL_TUNNEL_OFFSET` now, beside the `PODCTL_HOST` that already names the alias, and defaults to 0 so a
  single machine needs nothing. A value that is not a whole number in 0-1000 is refused rather than read as 0,
  because 0 is exactly the collision it was set to avoid. Found by building a foreign brand from scratch, with
  its own `brand.toml` shipping to a different host, and checking what the base still assumed: everything else
  passed, including the runtime in `lib/` and `py/`, which carries no brand name at all.
  **Migration:** a fleet that relied on the old map must now export the offset per machine. The alias that was
  the second machine takes `PODCTL_TUNNEL_OFFSET=1`, the third `2`; everything else was already 0.

- 2.10.1: the front page stops calling a proven host experimental. 2.5.3 promoted Verda after live runs on
  2026-09-17 and 2026-09-18: it set `experimental = False`, rewrote `hosts/verda/README.md` around what those
  runs answered, and recorded the change here. It did not touch the four other places that still said
  otherwise - this handbook's own host table, its 1.2 heading and opening line, `hosts/README.md`, and the
  top-level README in three spots, including the status table a visitor reads first and the sentence naming
  Verda an open item. So for a day the repository advertised a working host as unproven, which is the one
  direction a status claim should never be wrong in: overselling gets found out, underselling just loses
  people. All corrected against the provider flag, which was right the whole time.

- 2.10.0: the MCP client configuration stops being this repository's to own. 2.7.0 committed a `.mcp.json` at
  the root, which Claude Code and Cursor read automatically: every person who cloned the repository was
  prompted to enable a `comfy` server that could not work until they had comfy-mcp installed and a tunnel up.
  Researched rather than guessed, and the answer was upstream's: `comfy skills install` writes six skills
  across Claude Code, Cursor and `AGENTS.md` at user scope, with install / uninstall / status / validate, and
  `Comfy-Org/comfy-skills` describes itself as the single source of truth for the installer and the MCP
  server. comfy-mcp shipped 0.9.0 and 0.10.0 within two months. Competing with that would have drifted within
  weeks. The local case is upstream's now and the README says so; what stays is the case their tooling does
  not cover, because its local flow assumes ComfyUI is on your machine and its cloud flow assumes Comfy Cloud:
  a machine the base provisioned on a rented GPU. `podctl mcp` still writes the file, and it is gitignored,
  because it names one machine and one operator's paths. Also, two more places still resolved the testbed at
  the pre-2.6.0 path only: `suite/test_comfyui.py`, whose fallback made the whole tier skip under a bare
  `pytest suite/` in a standalone clone, and `gate()` in podctl. Both look in the base first and beside it
  second now, as `_base_use_testbed` does. That is the third instance of the same 2.6.0 oversight; the moral
  is that moving a file one level up means auditing every path expressed relative to it, not just the ones a
  test happens to cover.

- 2.9.2: the testbed finds a consumer repository's packages again. 2.6.0 moved `testbed.sh` into the base,
  which changed `$HERE` by one level and silently broke the glob that locates the packages:
  `$HERE/../*/packages/*/` from `<repo>/base/comfyui-base` resolves to `<repo>/base/*/packages/*/` and matches
  nothing. MEASURED on a reconstructed consumer layout: zero matches, so the testbed would have provisioned the
  base's own packs and none of the package's, and the `comfyui` tier would have run against a tree missing the
  very packs it exists to exercise - green, and meaningless. Exactly the failure `BASE_SH` was fixed for in
  2.6.0; its sibling went unnoticed because a standalone base has no packages either way, and that is the only
  shape the suite could see. The root is searched for now, one level up then two, and a candidate counts only
  when it holds a `<name>/<name>-script.sh` - two levels up from a standalone checkout is an unrelated
  directory. `--status` also prints what it derived and where from, because silent derivation is how this
  shipped. Proven on all three layouts: base-as-submodule, testbed.sh-beside-the-base, and standalone.

- 2.9.1: the forwarded ports say why they are forwarded. `TUNNEL_SERVICES` carries 9199 and 11434 next to
  ComfyUI's 8188 and JupyterLab's 8888, and the comment beside them explained only the per-alias offset (a
  collision measured on two live machines), never why those two ports were in the list at all. Read cold they
  look like leftovers, and this session came close to deleting 11434 as one. They are not: the base runs no
  metrics exporter and no inference server, but a PACKAGE may run one on the machine and talk to it on
  loopback, which is the shape a package takes when its whole point is that nothing leaves the box. Removing
  the forward would break such a package silently, from the Mac side, with nothing in the log to say why.
  Documented in both places, so the next reader does not have to rediscover it.

- 2.9.0: SAGE_REF can finally do what it was documented to do. It is described as the way to pin
  SageAttention, but the clone used `--depth 1 --branch "$SAGE_REF"`, and `--branch` takes a branch or a tag
  and refuses a commit: MEASURED, `git clone --depth 1 --branch <40-hex>` answers "Remote branch <sha> not
  found in upstream origin", so passing a commit failed at the clone for as long as the knob has existed. A
  commit is fetched by object name now, and it also short-circuits the `ls-remote` that resolves the cache
  key, which lists refs and would have resolved a commit to nothing. The DEFAULT stays `main`, deliberately:
  the wheel cache is keyed on the resolved upstream commit so that tracking upstream costs nothing, and a
  version-keyed cache would be exactly the stale pin the comment above that key refuses. Reproducibility is
  now available to anyone who wants it without making everyone else carry a pin. Also: the RunPod fixture in
  `suite/test_podctl.py` had a real-looking `machineId` and `dataCenterId` among its obviously-fake
  `fakevol001` and `faketmpl02`; both are fake now.

- 2.8.1: the MCP configuration names the `comfy` binary. comfy-mcp is a wrapper whose discovery and lifecycle
  tools shell out to comfy-cli, found through `COMFY_BIN` or `PATH`, and an MCP client is usually launched by a
  GUI whose `PATH` is not a shell's. 2.7.0 shipped neither transport with `COMFY_BIN` set, which left the ssh
  form giving an absolute path to `comfy-mcp` and then hoping the machine's `PATH` had `comfy`. MEASURED
  2026-09-19, driving the real stdio protocol against the testbed's ComfyUI: initialize returned protocol
  2025-06-18 and 39 tools listed either way, but `server_info` answered "Error executing tool server_info"
  without `COMFY_BIN` and answered properly with it. The unit tests could not have found this; they assert the
  shape of a config, and the shape was fine. Over ssh the binary beside `comfy-mcp` is named; over the tunnel
  this machine's is, when `comfy` can be found, and the command says so when it cannot rather than writing a
  config that will fail later.

- 2.8.0: the owned-box recipe says what a Blackwell card actually needs. `hosts/local/README.md` now sets out the
  chain the whole host hangs on — compute capability 12.0 becomes `sm_120`, `sm_120` means the CUDA 13 wheels are
  the only stable ones, CUDA 13 means driver >= 580, and torch is therefore the newest `+cu130` wheel for the
  interpreter's tag rather than a pinned number — with the file each link lives in, so a refusal can be read
  instead of guessed at. It also says why SageAttention is built from source here (no PyPI wheel carries
  `sm_100`/`sm_120` kernels) and what to pass when the card is not visible at build time. The MCP shape for a box
  with no pod and no ssh alias is written out, since 2.7.0's `podctl mcp` has nothing to point at locally. The row
  stays honest: still a recipe, and the host-report template is there for the first person to run it end to end.

- 2.7.0: the machine is drivable by an agent. `lib/45-mcp.sh` installs `comfy-cli` and `comfy-mcp` into the
  run's venv and binds comfy-cli to the discovered tree; `podctl mcp <machine>` writes the `.mcp.json`, over
  ssh by default and over the tunnel on request. The transport matters more than it looks: comfy-mcp's
  lifecycle and discovery tools only work where the tree is, so a tunnel-only client can run a workflow and
  little else, which is rarely what anyone wanted. §9.1 has the table. Telemetry was the one real obstacle —
  comfy-cli depends on mixpanel and posthog, rule 9 says nothing is uploaded, and a wheel's behaviour is
  invisible to the outbound-host test because it is not our source; both kill switches are exported in the
  stage and in the boot environment, `comfy tracking disable` writes the config too, and the suite asserts it
  so it cannot regress quietly. MEASURED 2026-09-19, the stage run against a real venv: comfy-cli 1.20.0 and
  comfy-mcp 0.10.0 installed, the workspace bound, and torch 2.14.0 / torchvision 0.29.0 / torchaudio 2.11.0
  unchanged afterwards — none of comfy-cli's 29 dependencies is torch, torchvision, torchaudio or numpy, and
  the constraints file is passed anyway. That run also settled how to install: `$PY -m pip` works on a pod
  because 30-venv.sh seeds the venv, but a venv built without `--seed` has no pip at all, and uv built the
  venv in the first place — so the stage uses uv and stops depending on a detail it does not control.
  `BASE_MCP=0` skips the whole stage, which never fails a run.

- 2.6.0: the testbed the base tests itself with now lives in the base. `testbed.sh` was carried by the brand
  repositories, so `suite/test_unit.py` skipped the `comfyui` tier by name — "this base is its own repository
  (2.2.0); the brand repositories carry one" — and a clone of THIS repository could never run it at all. That is a
  poor thing to hand someone who forked the repository in order to work on it, and it is the whole tier that
  proves a pack actually imports. `testbed.sh` ships here now; `_base_use_testbed` and `verify.sh` check
  `<base>/testbed` first and `base/testbed` second, taking one root whole so the port file always comes from the
  same place as the tree. Two things had to be fixed on the way in. `BASE_SH` was hard-coded to
  `$HERE/comfyui-base/base.sh`, which from the repository root resolves to nothing: MEASURED, the script then
  printed "no ComfyUI Base beside this script — only EXTRA packs are provisioned" and, since EXTRA has been empty
  since 2026-09-04, would have provisioned a ComfyUI with no custom nodes at all, silently. And `VENDORED` was
  three hard-coded `../<brand>/packages/...` paths — a brand's name in a repository whose first design rule is
  that nothing here knows one, and a list that had already gone stale. Both are derived now, and a test asserts no
  brand is named. `testbed.sh` is deliberately NOT in `BASE_MEMBERS`: the zip is what goes to a pod, and a CPU
  testbed has no business there.

- 2.5.14: the suite runs without a RunPod credential. The three `test_podio_fetch_*` tests drive `PodIO.fetch`
  against a fake ssh and never reach the API, but `PodIO(None, …)` builds a `RunPodProvider`, whose constructor
  loads the key eagerly (`Api(load_api_key())`), and `load_api_key` falls back to `~/.runpod/config.toml`. On a
  maintainer's machine that file exists, so the tests passed; anywhere without a RunPod account they raised
  before the first assertion. MEASURED 2026-09-19 on a GitHub Actions ubuntu-24.04 runner: 3 failed, 293 passed,
  15 skipped — the first run of the new CI job, which is exactly the class of bug a gate that only ever runs on
  the author's machine cannot find. The tests now put a placeholder key in their own environment. Nothing about
  auth is asserted by them, so nothing is being pretended; the credential is scaffolding for a constructor.

- 2.5.13: a `models/` symlink left pointing outside the volume is repointed at it. `_base_library_link` wrote
  `$COMFY/models -> $BASE_LIBRARY/models` when a machine had a separate library mounted; that symlink lives ON THE
  STORE, so every later machine inherits it, and since 2.5.2 `BASE_LIBRARY` is correctly ignored when the whole
  root IS the store, which means the function that created it returns at its first line and can never repair it.
  A second mount of the same store hid this until the release that stopped making one. MEASURED 2026-09-19 on a
  fresh boot: the link dangled, `df` on it failed, the disk gate read 0.00 GB free on a store with 272 GB free and
  refused every install, and ComfyUI's own models directory did not resolve. Repaired in `base_discover`, before
  `M` is chosen, rather than in hygiene, because hygiene runs after the model step this breaks.
- 2.5.12: the deletion is staged and reversible. Every guard before it is an INFERENCE about identity, and 2.5.11
  fixed one that was wrong only after it had offered 63.52 GB of live models; an inference can be wrong again in a
  shape nobody has met, and the consequence is a model that exists nowhere while the ledger still calls it
  installed. So `base_prune` now RENAMES each candidate aside in its own directory (atomic, never across a
  filesystem), re-stats every destination the MODELS table declares, and removes nothing unless all of them are
  still present at their declared size. If one vanished or changed size, every rename is undone, the step fails and
  says which model it was. It needs to know nothing about mounts, inodes or symlinks to be safe, because it checks
  the thing that actually matters rather than inferring it.
- 2.5.11: a file reached by two paths is not a duplicate of itself. `base_prune` offered 63.52 GB of LIVE models
  for deletion on a three-machine store, measured 2026-09-19: the store was mounted at two points and
  `ComfyUI/models` symlinked into the second, so every file was indexed under two path strings, while the
  predicate is basename plus size and the identity check compared strings that `cd && pwd -P` had only collapsed
  SYMLINKS in. `rm -f` unlinks the one directory entry, so the model would have gone from both paths. Now a `-ef`
  test (dev:ino) against the destination and between candidates, so a second mountpoint or a hardlink can never
  reach the deletion list or inflate "reclaimable"; and under `BASE_VOLUME_SHARED` the duplicate sweep is skipped
  outright, because a run that cannot see the other machines' ledgers cannot decide what is surplus on a store
  they share. `BASE_YES=1` removes the prompt rather than answering it, which is what made this a silent
  unattended deletion in a baked image rather than a footgun.
- 2.5.10: the Mac gate works again. 2.5.7's `test_unit_each_workflow_gets_its_own_local_port` loaded
  `_build/pod/podctl.py` with its own inline import instead of the `_load()` helper beside it, and that helper
  is where the "not a repo checkout" skip lives. The shipped zip contains no `_build/`, so the test raised
  FileNotFoundError in every run from the extracted zip, which is exactly the run `podctl install` performs
  before it uploads anything. Every session's install stopped at the gate, for a reason that had nothing to do
  with what it was installing. Found while installing a package 2026-09-19.
- 2.5.9: a video package's last node no longer dies on the encoder it asked for. VideoHelperSuite prefers its
  own bundled imageio_ffmpeg binary, and that build carries NO nvenc encoders, so a format asking for
  `h264_nvenc` failed at `VHS_VideoCombine` with "Unknown encoder" AFTER the whole sample had been computed and
  paid for. Measured on a GPU on 2026-09-19, on a render that had already cleared its policy gate and produced
  frames. The Verda host now installs `ffmpeg` beside `nfs-common` and `python3-venv`, and the launch line sets
  `VHS_FORCE_FFMPEG_PATH` when a system ffmpeg is present AND has `h264_nvenc`. The nvenc condition is the point:
  forcing a system build without it would trade one silently wrong encoder for another, and the bundled one at
  least works for the stock formats. Two tests, one per half.
- 2.5.8: and so are the SETTINGS, which is the same bug one path away. 2.5.7 moved `workflows/` to the
  directory the server reads and scoped its guard to that path, so an identical split in
  `comfy.settings.json` survived untouched. This package sets `pysssss.ImageFeed.Location=hidden` as hygiene,
  with the comment "it covers App Mode's Run button", and wrote it into ComfyUI's own tree while the server read
  the machine's. The setting never took effect, the image feed sat over the Run button, and every Playwright
  click landed on a `DIV.pysssss-image-feed-menu`: no `POST /prompt` was ever made, so a whole GPU sweep
  reported "did not queue" for every case with no reason attached. `force=True` does not help, because it skips
  the actionability check and still dispatches at the point where the overlay is. Measured 2026-09-19 with
  `document.elementFromPoint` on the Run button's own centre. `lib/80-server.sh` and `lib/70-hygiene.sh` now ask
  `_base_user_dir`, and the static guard is widened from `workflows` to the whole of `$COMFY/user` so the next
  instance cannot hide one path away again.
- 2.5.7: the workflow is written where the SERVER actually reads it. 2.5.0 moved the server's
  `--user-directory` to `BASE_LOCAL_STATE` (`lib/70-hygiene.sh`), because two machines sharing one store cannot
  share one `user/`, and left every WRITER pointing at `$COMFY/user`. So on a shared-root machine the installer
  put each package's workflow in ComfyUI's own tree, the server read the machine's, and
  `GET /api/userdata?dir=workflows` answered `[]`. No package could be opened from the server's own workflow
  list by name, which is exactly what an App Mode pass is required to do. Measured on three machines on
  2026-09-18, one per brand, each holding workflows in a directory nothing served. `_base_user_dir` and
  `_base_workflows_dir` now answer it once and `lib/60-sync.sh`, `lib/80-server.sh` and `lib/90-ledger.sh` all
  ask, so the halves cannot drift apart again; `lib/20-comfyui.sh`'s scaffold still lays out ComfyUI's own
  `user/default/workflows`, which should exist whether or not this machine serves from it.
- 2.5.6: the terminal a customer needs, and four things that had to be right before it could exist. JupyterLab
  now GENERATES a token where `BASE_LISTEN` is loopback, so the machine is not dark until somebody invents a
  credential; on a public bind with no credential 2.1.0's refusal is unchanged, because a generated token there is
  still a service on a proxy URL that nobody asked to start. The token is written owner-only to `state/tokens.env`
  and is NEVER printed: the boot log is a file on the volume, and with a shared store every machine mounts it, so
  the rule that has forbidden logging a supplied token since 2.1.0 applies to a generated one too. `podctl jupyter
  <machine>` reads it over ssh and prints the URL. The IP in that hint is read from the machine's own NIC
  (`hostname -I`); an earlier draft asked api.ipify.org, which the outbound-host allowlist caught — the base asks
  the network nothing about itself. `--port LOCAL:REMOTE` and a per-alias offset (`tunnel_locals`) because with one
  GPU per workflow every machine serves 8188 and one number can reach only one of them; a plain `8188` is
  unchanged. `_base_local_dirs` creates the machine-local directories the launch line names, which is why ComfyUI
  refused to start on a shared root: `--user-directory` pointed at a path no machine had made yet. And
  `recall_library` no longer feeds the shared workspace back to itself as a separate library, which left a stale
  fstab line naming a mount that no longer exists.
- 2.5.5: the GPU lease is the MACHINE's, so it moved off the volume to `BASE_LOCAL_STATE`. It was written to
  `$BASE_VOLUME/comfy-base/state/gpu.lease`, which is per machine only while the volume is. Under the shared root
  (2.5.0) `/workspace` IS one store that every machine mounts, so that one file became a global mutex: three
  machines, three GPUs, one lease, and `lease_blocks` refusing whoever asked second. That is the exact inverse of
  the shape's own claim, which is that installs serialise on the mkdir lock and RUNNING does not, precisely so
  several GPUs can render at once. A pre-2.5.5 lease still on the volume is REPORTED by `podctl lease` and not
  obeyed, because obeying it would reinstate the mutex and it may belong to another machine entirely.
  The rule, and the one to apply to anything added here: anything about the MACHINE is per machine, anything
  about the WORK is shared. Deliberately not moved with it, after checking every `VOLUME_ROOT`-derived path
  rather than the one that bit: `pkgs_dir()` and `upload --to` are the work's; `state/logs/` is the machine's but
  the SHELL side writes there too (`lib/10-discover.sh:5`, `lib/boot.sh`), so moving only the driver's half would
  split an install's logs across two directories, which is worse than one interleaved directory and wants a
  two-sided change. `state/host.env` is the machine's too and is worse than stale: it PROPAGATES, because a
  machine that ensures correctly has `recall_library` read another machine's `BASE_LIBRARY` back out of the
  shared file and mount the store twice. Measured on two machines 2026-09-18; it is owed its own release.
- 2.5.4: a dry run is a report, not a gate, where a report is all it can honestly be. `--check` failed any
  `LOCAL` model row whose file was not on disk, although a `LOCAL` row is placed by the package's own
  `pkg_pre_models`, which does nothing under `BASE_DRY`. So the file was absent BY DESIGN at check time and its
  absence carried no information, and `podctl install --pkg` was gated on a condition the gate itself created:
  every package with a `LOCAL` row stopped at "nothing was run" before it could place the file. Both `LOCAL`
  branches, the file one and the folder-snapshot one, now report the row as unjudgeable **when the package
  declares `pkg_pre_models`**, and are unchanged otherwise: with no such hook a missing file really is missing
  and saying so before the run is the useful answer. A real run still fails either way. Measured on
  a package whose engine is CivitAI only and has no Hub mirror. Four cases in one test hold it,
  including the positive control that a `LOCAL` file which IS present still reports ok, so the guard cannot
  quietly widen to every row. Also: a `SUPERSEDED` entry the sweep can never match (a path, or a dotfile) is
  still skipped, because that sweep matches basenames only and a path pattern would widen it across a store
  several machines share, but it now says so once per pattern instead of silently doing nothing.
- 2.5.3: the Verda host is no longer EXPERIMENTAL. The three questions its README asked are answered by live
  runs: the ssh user is root, the startup script does re-run on a redeploy and fstab survives on the OS volume, and
  `ip` populates within about 30 s. The driver no longer prints the warning on every command.
- 2.5.2: proven on a live machine, and two things it found. `ensure --workspace-shared` could not swap a mount
  under a running system, so the script reported success while the machine was still on its own disk; it now says
  REBOOT and fails the step, because a report line that lies is worse than an error. And `BASE_VOLUME_SHARED` with
  `BASE_LIBRARY` are alternatives rather than layers: together they mount one store twice and the run warns about
  its own tree seen through the second path, so a shared root now ignores the library and says so. Measured with
  the whole root on the store: a cold `import torch` costs 9.28 s against 2.15 s local, warm 1.55 s.
- 2.5.1: `_base_auth_file` read its own argument. `local a="$1" b="...$a"` expands every word before `local`
  binds any, so the second read the CALLER's scope; it worked only because every in-tree caller held `name` set to
  the same token name, and a caller holding a different one sent a bearer token for the wrong name with no error.
  The library link also ignores everything ComfyUI itself ships, `models/configs/*.yaml` as well as the
  placeholders, and copies it onto the library rather than discarding it.
- 2.5.0: `BASE_VOLUME_SHARED`, the whole root on the shared store (§0.14), which is what makes a machine
  disposable rather than only its models shared. `user/` and `temp/` move to `BASE_LOCAL_STATE`; installs take a
  mkdir lock on the store, honoured for two hours and then broken with the owner named; running is unlocked. On
  Verda `podctl ensure --workspace-shared` mounts the shared volume AS `/workspace`, so the machine needs no data
  volume and `startup.sh` never hunts for one.
- 2.4.0: `BASE_LIBRARY`, a model library several machines mount at once (§0.13). Discovery prefers it over
  `extra_model_paths.yaml`, which is not yet written on a machine's first install; staging is per machine so two
  installs cannot collide on one half-file; the disk gate measures the library rather than the volume. On Verda:
  a shared volume is resolved from the account and attached by type and location, never by name stem.
- 2.3.0: the first public release. Models come from Hugging Face and GitHub only; model families are a brand's list,
  not the base's; the loader map covers ComfyUI's core loaders and the shared packs', packages extend it with
  `LOADER_CATS`; the fake-pod layouts are `official | community | bare | volume`.
