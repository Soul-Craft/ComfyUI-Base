"""pkgdirs.py: where a consumer's packages are, in either of the two shapes a consumer can have (3.6.0).

    python3 py/pkgdirs.py [<root>]          # the package dirs of <root> (else the resolved consumer root), one per line
    python3 py/pkgdirs.py --root [<root>]   # the consumer root itself: <root>, else $BASE_WORKSPACE, else the submodule shape

Exit 0 with the answer (nothing printed by --root when there is no consumer root: a documented outcome); exit 1 with
"consumer root <X> does not exist" on stderr when a named root (the argument or $BASE_WORKSPACE) is not a directory.
The shell walkers treat any other non-zero exit as the helper failing and stop, never as "no packages".

A consumer keeps its packages in one of two shapes:

  - submodule:  <root>/base/comfyui-base is this base, and the packages are <root>/<brand>/packages/<name>/
  - workspace:  one repository per package, cloned side by side as <root>/<brand>-<name>/, with the base read
                from $COMFY_BASE (a shared checkout that is NOT inside the workspace). $BASE_WORKSPACE names <root>.

Every cross-package walker (package.py --all, podctl's pin scan, verify.sh, testbed.sh, basetest.converted_packages)
asks this module, so the rule is written once. It used to be a `*/packages/*` glob in five places, each with its own
guard against a base that is its own repository, and none of them could see a workspace. Stdlib only, no side effects.
