"""ComfyUI Base — the canvas library: what every workflow package's suite and canvas tool share.

Each function was written against the real frontend (ComfyUI 1.49.6) and checked there. Nothing here knows a package:
ids, titles, budgets and the display come from the package's `CANVAS = CanvasSpec(...)` in its
suite.py, which `load_spec()` reads by ast so the tools in `_build/canvas/` see the same declaration
the tests do.
