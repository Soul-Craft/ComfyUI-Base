"""ComfyUI Base — the generic canvas tests every workflow package runs against its own declaration.

In a package's suite.py, after its constants:

    from canvas import CanvasSpec, Budgets
    CANVAS = CanvasSpec(user_facing=USER_FACING, markers=MARKERS, cuda_only=CUDA_ONLY, start_card=992, ...)
    from canvastest import *          # pytest collects these test_* functions in the suite's module

The tests read the declaration through the `canvas` fixture (request.module.CANVAS) and the workflow through
the suite's own `wf` fixture (a module-scoped dict; one is provided here if the suite defines none). Every
number they assert is either the frontend's own (the level-of-detail cliff, computeSize() from sizes.json)
or a corpus threshold from canvas.Budgets, which a package may override field by field in its declaration.

Tiers (markers the suite's pytest.ini must declare): uiux, snapshot, config. The suite's marker loop gives
each test its tier by name prefix; the four legacy names (test_no_node_collisions, test_spacing_rules,
test_toggle_panels_fit_rows, test_note_boxes_fit_content) are uiux.

Each test was written against a real defect; the docstrings keep that history because it says why the
number is what it is."""
