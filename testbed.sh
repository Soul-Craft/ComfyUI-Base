#  ComfyUI testbed — a shared, real ComfyUI + node-pack tree for every project
#  folder in this directory to test against.
#
#      bash testbed.sh            # provision/update source only  (fast, ~500 MB)
#      bash testbed.sh --server   # also build a CPU venv and start ComfyUI
#      COMFY_REF=master bash testbed.sh --server   # ComfyUI at a ref NEWER than the newest release (default: the newest release)
#  3.0.0: always the newest. ComfyUI at its newest release, every pack at its remote's HEAD, the newest Python uv
#  provides, torch upgraded, and every requirement installed from one pin-free set (py/reqlift.py), so ComfyUI's
#  own == pins (its frontend packages) never hold anything below its newest. --latest is accepted and changes nothing.
#      bash testbed.sh --stop     # stop the server
#      bash testbed.sh --status   # what is here and what is running
#
#  Then, from any package folder that runs on ComfyUI Base:
#      bash "<name>-script.sh" test             # auto-detects base/testbed and the server on the port --server took
#  Overrides: BASE_NODE_SRC="<this dir>/testbed"  BASE_SERVER=127.0.0.1:8199
#  (every package with a suite finds it the same way: BASE_NODE_SRC / BASE_SERVER, auto-detected by `test`;
#   --server writes the port it chose to .testbed-server.port beside this script, which the base's runner
#   and its _build/verify.sh read; --stop removes it)
#
#  WHICH PACKS
#  The base derives them: `base/comfyui-base/base.sh list-packs */` merges the four
#  shared base packs with every converted package's PACKS table, pinned to the
#  commits the pod installs. EXTRA below would hold the packs of packages NOT yet
#  converted onto the base; each conversion deletes its rows here.
#
#  WHY IT LIVES HERE, NOT AT ~/ComfyUI
#  Pod discovery scans $HOME/ComfyUI, /workspace/* and /ComfyUI. A tree at
#  ~/ComfyUI would be found by a plain `bash <name>-script.sh` run, which would
#  then rebuild its venv and restart it. This path is invisible to that scan.
#
#  WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT PROVE
#  ✔ source: every node type, widget order and input name the workflow uses,
#    read from each pack's real source — the checks that catch a pod install
#    failing to load the graph.
#  ✔ server (--server): the pure-Python packs import and register under a
#    current Python, and /object_info answers.
#  ✘ CUDA: this host has no NVIDIA GPU. SolAttn (Triton), the Nvidia RTX nodes
#    and the int8-ConvRot loader (comfy-kitchen) cannot import here.
#  ✘ rendering: needs the weights and an sm_120 GPU. That is the pod.
